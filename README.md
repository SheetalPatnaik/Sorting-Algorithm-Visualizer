# 🔢 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## 📝 About This Project
Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science, and this project provides a **visual representation** of various sorting algorithms. The tool helps users understand how sorting works by animating the step-by-step process.

## 🌟 Features
✅ **Supports Multiple Sorting Algorithms**:  
   - Bubble Sort  
   - Selection Sort  
   - Insertion Sort  
   - Merge Sort  
   - Quick Sort  

✅ **Interactive Visualization** – Users can observe real-time sorting steps  
✅ **Custom Input** – Ability to modify array size and values  
✅ **Speed Control** – Adjust the speed of sorting animations  
✅ **Comparison of Sorting Techniques** – Analyze the efficiency of different algorithms  
✅ **Intuitive UI** – Simple and user-friendly design  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: None (Pure client-side visualization)  
- **Visualization Library**: JavaScript Canvas / D3.js (if applicable)  

## 🎥 How It Works
- 1️⃣ Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- 2️⃣ Adjust the array size and speed using sliders.
- 3️⃣ Click "Start Sorting" to visualize the process.
- 4️⃣ Observe the animation as numbers get sorted step by step.
